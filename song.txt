Hey Brother, there's an endless road to re-discover.
Hey Sister, Know the water's sweet but blood is thicker
Ooooh if the sky comes falling down, for you
There's nothing in this world I wouldn't do

Hey Brother, do you still believe in one another?
Hey Sister, do you still believe in love I wonder?
Ooooh if the sky comes falling down, for you
There's nothing in this world I wouldn't do
